                visited his office due to a torn rotator cuff and bicep tear. He
                conducted a comprehensive analysis of the MRIs and conducted a
                complete physical examination. He clearly communicated the
                diagnosis and discussed potential courses of action. Dr. DeMarco
                patiently addressed all my inquiries, ensuring I fully
                understood my situation. Additionally, his efficient staff
                managed all the necessary paperwork, facilitating further
                examinations. I am highly satisfied with Dr. DeMarc0's
                professionalism and compassionate bedside manner and have highly
                recommended him to friends, family and colleagues."

                "Dr DeMarco is an amazing Surgeon. He speaks to people not at
                them and uses terminology people understand. My husband had an
                injury which could have made him have to retire but Dr took
                amazing care of him and got him back to his active self. As for
                reviews of his staff and scheduling his staff is wonderful.
                People don't realize or maybe understand Dr is a surgeon and
                sometimes due to surgery yes we have had our appointment
                changed, but that's the way it is. Dr DeMarco is not a 9-5 Dr he
                is a surgeon, and from experience the best ones are the ones you
                need to wait to see. So if you want a Dr to get you to the best
                recovery you can hope for this is the office for you. Thank you
                to the staff and Dr for preventing my husband from having to
                retire from an injury , and giving him back his active
                lifestyle. We can never thank you enough"

                on my rotator cuff on wednesday, sunday morning I called his
                service at 745 am by 8 am he called me back. I told him the
                bandages fell off my shoulder, by 9 am he came to my house and
                fixed me all up. He is a perfect example of what a dr is, that
                was so nice of him to come to my home on a Sunday morning to
                make sure i was good. Thank you so much Dr. I highly recommend
                dr DeMarco . Caring, honest, and most important he gives his
                patients the security of knowing hes there for you"
