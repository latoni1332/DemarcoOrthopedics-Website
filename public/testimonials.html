            “I can’t say enough good things about Dr. DeMarco. Without him I
            would not be walking. I fell from a ladder, went to the emergency
            room where I was referred to another Doctor. I waited five days for
            an appointment with an open fracture in the bone above my ankle.
            That doctor then cancelled my appointment. A friend told me about
            Dr. DeMarco. I was seen that day and was scheduled for surgery the
            next day. My first surgery went great and my second one is scheduled
            for two weeks. Dr. DeMarco treated me like I was his own father. He
            is a great surgeon, a great doctor and a fine man. I’m 79 years old
            and have seen plenty of doctors in my day. This one is the old
            fashioned kind of caring compassionate doctor you don’t see around
            anymore”. Eddie R.

            “I went to Dr. DeMarco desperate for help. Two other orthopaedics I
            went to told me I needed surgery but I was not ready to go that
            route because I had no one to care for my family while I
            recuperated. Dr. DeMarco listened to my concerns and gave me
            alternate methods of treatment while keeping the surgical option as
            a last resort. Thanks to him I was able to avoid surgery until the
            time is right for me .” Linda H.

            orthopaedist recommended by his coach was given an appointment six
            weeks later. Another parent told me about Dr. DeMarco. His office
            gave me an appointment that night. He was treated and was back on
            the field in no time. I tell everyone to go there now.” Tony S.

            “I may not be here today if it were not for this doctor. I went for
            what I thought was an orthopaedic problem. I had cancer that was
            missed by another doctor. He saved my life. I will always be
            grateful to him for spending so much time with me and for helping
            coordinate my cancer treatment even though it had nothing to do with
            orthopaedics.” Vincent D.
